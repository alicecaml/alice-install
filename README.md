# Dune Binary Installer

## Install Dune

Paste this into your terminal to install Dune:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml-dune/dune-bin-install/refs/heads/main/install.sh | sh -s 3.19.1

No installation of opam or OCaml is necessary. Dune will be installed under `~/.local` by default.
